# Java Streams API
One of the biggest challenges during my journey in Java Programming was that I was used to writing my code imperatively. Of course, I found out that this is something inevitable for someone who's just starting scratching the surface of OOP. Later on I discovered the declarative way of things by hitting [this course](https://amigoscode.com/p/java-streams), which covers one of the most popular approaches in Java programming.

# Note
In order to help myself in becoming better at functional programming I created many notes as comments in this repository. The only thing is that I wrote them in Greek, which is something I will fix as soon as possible. Following is a list of topics as written on the official website of the course.
